Additional thanks to Nikita for the macroeconomics lessons‚Äîthis was the hardest subject for me, but I ended up really enjoying it. \n These were an interesting three months, where we could chat with each other and offer tips. Competing in the leaderboard was exciting, and while I didn‚Äôt get a prize, that competition pushed me to be more responsible with the material and homework. I started to understand how it all works much better. Comparing my knowledge of trading and personal mindset before and after the course, the difference is massive. \n I realize my journey is just beginning, but I recognized my emotional weaknesses during the tests on the course, and I know now what to work on. \n It might not be easy at first, but you gave me the drive and determination not to give up.
